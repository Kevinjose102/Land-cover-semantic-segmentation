Land-cover semantic segmentation system built using PyTorch for pixel-wise classification of aerial or satellite imagery. The objective is to accurately identify and label regions such as vegetation, water bodies, roads, buildings, and other terrain categories. The pipeline includes dataset preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, validation, evaluation using standard segmentation metrics, and visualization of predicted masks.

The codebase is structured to be modular and extensible, allowing experimentation with different model architectures, loss functions, and optimization strategies. Training and experimentation are performed on a GPU-enabled local environment to enable efficient iteration and performance analysis.

The primary goal is to gain strong practical expertise in semantic segmentation while developing a complete end-to-end computer vision workflow aligned with real-world machine learning systems.
